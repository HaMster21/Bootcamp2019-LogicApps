# Global Azure Bootcamp Rostock, Germany

This is the source of the workshop part about Azure Logic Apps.

The relevant bits are in the src folder. You'll find a solution there containing an ARM template project for deployment in Azure.

## Tools

I recommend using VS2019. Make sure you have the Azure workload enabled.

To develop Logic Apps in Visual Studio, Microsoft provides VS-Plugins. For VS 2019, use [this one](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VinaySinghMSFT.AzureLogicAppsToolsForVS2019)

## Docs and pointers

If you are new to serverless on Azure, I'd recommend working through the learning resources in [Microsofts learn platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/create-serverless-applications/)

Microsoft provides a library with community templates for using ARM projects. Great way to peek at other peoples working templates. You find that [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates)

All resources have a reference that list required and optional parameters, default values and the like. They are [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/templates/microsoft.logic/2016-06-01/workflows)
